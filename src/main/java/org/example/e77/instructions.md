# Exercise 77: Find and Print the Highest Value in an Array

## Objective
Learn how to use arrays in Java to find and print the highest value.

## Instructions

**Find and Print the Highest Value in an Array**

In this project, you will write a small program that finds and prints the highest value in a given array.

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare and Initialize the Array**
    - Create an array and initialize it with the following values: [5, 4, 8]

2. **Find the Highest Value**
    - Use a loop to iterate through the array and find the highest value.

3. **Print the Highest Value**
    - Print the highest value found in the array.

## Expected Output
```
8
```

## Tips
- Ensure your loop has the correct condition to avoid infinite loops.
- Remember to use the correct syntax for accessing array elements.

## Additional Information
- **Array**: An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
- **Loop**: A loop repeatedly executes a block of statements a specified number of times.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect array declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the loop condition and array access statements are correct.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to find and print the highest value in an array in Java. Happy coding!
