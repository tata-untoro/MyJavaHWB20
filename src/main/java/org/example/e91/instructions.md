# Exercise 91: Convert String Case

## Objective
Learn how to convert the case of strings in Java.

## Instructions

**Convert String Case**

In this project, you will create strings, assign values to them, and convert their cases.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create String Variables**
    - Create a `String` variable named `str1` and assign the value `"syntax technologies"` to it.
    - Create a `String` variable named `str2` and assign the value `"SYNTAX TECHNOLOGIES"` to it.

2. **Convert the Case**
    - Use the `toUpperCase()` method of the `String` class to convert `str1` to uppercase.
    - Use the `toLowerCase()` method of the `String` class to convert `str2` to lowercase.

3. **Print the Results**
    - Print the converted values of `str1` and `str2`.

## Example Output
```
SYNTAX TECHNOLOGIES
syntax technologies
```

## Tips
- Ensure your string variables are declared and assigned correctly.
- Remember to use the correct syntax for calling the `toUpperCase()` and `toLowerCase()` methods and printing the results.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the string variables are assigned the correct values and the case conversions are printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to convert the case of strings in Java. Happy coding!
