# Exercise 68: Print Specific Characters from an Array

## Objective
Learn how to create and use arrays in Java to store and print specific characters to form a word.

## Instructions

**Print Specific Characters from an Array**

In this project, you will write a small program that creates an array of characters, stores specific values, and then prints selected characters to form the word "syntax".

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare and Initialize the Array**
    - Create an array of characters and store the values 's', 'a', 'y', 'b', 'n', 'c', 't', 'd', 'a', 'e', 'x'.

2. **Print the Selected Characters**
    - Print the characters at the indices that form the word "syntax".

## Expected Output
```
syntax
```

## Tips
- Ensure your array is declared and initialized correctly.
- Use the correct indices to print the characters that form the word "syntax".

## Additional Information
- **Array**: An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
- **Indices**: Array indices in Java start at 0.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect array declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the correct indices are used to print the characters.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use arrays in Java. Happy coding!
