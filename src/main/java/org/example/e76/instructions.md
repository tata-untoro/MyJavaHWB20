# Exercise 76: Double the Values in a 2D Array

## Objective
Learn how to manipulate and print values from a 2D array in Java.

## Instructions

**Double the Values in a 2D Array**

In this project, you will write a small program that doubles the values of every element in a 2D array and prints the result.

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare and Initialize the 2D Array**
    - Create a 2D array and initialize it with the following values:
    ```
    {
        {1.4, 2.0, 3.3, 2.0},
        {4.0, 1.5, 6.1, 1.0},
        {1.2, 3.1, 4.0, 1.6}
    }
    ```

2. **Double the Values**
    - Use nested loops to iterate through the 2D array and double the value of each element.

3. **Print the Updated 2D Array Values**
    - Use nested loops to iterate through the 2D array and print each value.

## Example Output
```
2.8 4.0 6.6 4.0
8.0 3.0 12.2 2.0
2.4 6.2 8.0 3.2
```

## Tips
- Ensure your loops have the correct conditions to avoid infinite loops.
- Remember to use the correct syntax for accessing and modifying array elements.

## Additional Information
- **2D Array**: A 2D array is an array of arrays, where each element is itself an array. It can be visualized as a table with rows and columns.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect array declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the loop conditions and array access statements are correct.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to manipulate and print values from a 2D array in Java. Happy coding!
