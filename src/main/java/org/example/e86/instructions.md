# Exercise 86: Create a Student Class and Object

## Objective
Learn how to create a class and objects in Java.

## Instructions

**Create a Student Class and Object**

In this project, you will create a class, define its properties, create an object of the class, and print the object's properties.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create a Class**
    - Create a class named `Student`.

2. **Declare Variables**
    - Inside the class, declare a `String` variable named `name` and an `int` variable named `roll_no`.

3. **Create an Object**
    - Create an object of the `Student` class.
    - Assign the value `"John"` to the `name` variable.
    - Assign the value `2` to the `roll_no` variable.

4. **Print the Properties**
    - Print the values of the `name` and `roll_no` variables in the following format:
      ```
      Name is John and roll number is 2
      ```

## Example Output
```
Name is John and roll number is 2
```

## Tips
- Ensure your class and variables are declared correctly.
- Remember to use the correct syntax for creating an object and accessing its properties.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the variables are assigned the correct values and printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to create classes and objects in Java. Happy coding!
