# Exercise 67: Print Array Values at Even Indices

## Objective
Learn how to create and use arrays in Java to store and print values at specific indices.

## Instructions

**Print Array Values at Even Indices**

In this project, you will write a small program that creates an array of integers, stores specific values, and then prints the values stored at even indices, including index 0.

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare and Initialize the Array**
    - Create an array of integers and store the values 45, 78, 12, 67, 55, 89, 23, 77, and 88.

2. **Print the Array Values at Even Indices**
    - Use a loop to iterate through the array and print the values at even indices followed by a space.

## Expected Output
```
45 12 55 23 88
```

## Tips
- Ensure your loop has the correct condition to avoid infinite loops.
- Remember to use the correct syntax for accessing array elements.

## Additional Information
- **Array**: An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
- **Loop**: A loop repeatedly executes a block of statements a specified number of times.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect array declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the loop condition and array access statements are correct.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use arrays in Java. Happy coding!
