# Exercise 90: Check if a String is Empty

## Objective
Learn how to check if a string is empty in Java.

## Instructions

**Check if a String is Empty**

In this project, you will create strings, assign values to them, and check if they are empty.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create String Variables**
    - Create a `String` variable named `s1` and assign the value `"hello"` to it.
    - Create a `String` variable named `s2` and assign an empty string `""` to it.

2. **Check if the Strings are Empty**
    - Use the `isEmpty()` method of the `String` class to check if `s1` is empty.
    - Use the `isEmpty()` method of the `String` class to check if `s2` is empty.

3. **Print the Results**
    - Print the results of the `isEmpty()` checks.

## Example Output
```
false
true
```

## Tips
- Ensure your string variables are declared and assigned correctly.
- Remember to use the correct syntax for calling the `isEmpty()` method and printing the result.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the string variables are assigned the correct values and the empty checks are printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to check if strings are empty in Java. Happy coding!
