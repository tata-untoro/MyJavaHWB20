# Exercise 84: Print Multiplication Table Pattern

## Objective
Learn how to use 2D arrays and nested loops in Java to print multiplication tables.

## Instructions

**Print Multiplication Table Pattern**

In this project, you will write a small program that uses a 2D array and nested loops to print a multiplication table pattern.

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare and Initialize the 2D Array**
    - Create a 2D array and initialize it to store the multiplication table values.

2. **Fill the 2D Array with Multiplication Table Values**
    - Use nested loops to fill the 2D array with multiplication table values.

3. **Print the Pattern**
    - Use nested loops to iterate through the 2D array and print the pattern.

## Example Output
```
6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60
7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 70
8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72 80
9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81 90
10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
```

## Tips
- Ensure your loops have the correct conditions to avoid infinite loops.
- Remember to use the correct syntax for accessing array elements.

## Additional Information
- **2D Array**: A 2D array is an array of arrays, where each element is itself an array. It can be visualized as a table with rows and columns.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect array declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the loop conditions and array access statements are correct.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use 2D arrays and nested loops in Java to print multiplication tables. Happy coding!
