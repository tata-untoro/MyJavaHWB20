# Exercise 89: Find the Length of a String

## Objective
Learn how to manipulate strings in Java.

## Instructions

**Find the Length of a String**

In this project, you will create a string, assign it a value, and find out how many characters it contains.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create a String Variable**
    - Create a `String` variable named `name` and assign the value `"Timmy"` to it.

2. **Find the Length**
    - Use the `length()` method of the `String` class to find out how many characters are in the string.

3. **Print the Length**
    - Print the length of the string in the following format:
      ```
      Based on the given string it will print the length
      ```

## Example Output
```
5
```

## Tips
- Ensure your string variable is declared and assigned correctly.
- Remember to use the correct syntax for calling the `length()` method and printing the result.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the string variable is assigned the correct value and the length is printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to manipulate strings in Java. Happy coding!
