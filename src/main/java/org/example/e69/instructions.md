# Exercise 69: Print Array of Strings

## Objective
Learn how to create and use arrays in Java to store and print a series of strings.

## Instructions

**Print Array of Strings**

In this project, you will write a small program that creates an array of strings, stores specific values, and then prints all values in one line.

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare and Initialize the Array**
    - Create an array of strings and store the values "This", "is", "array", "of", "strings".

2. **Print the Array Values in One Line**
    - Use a loop to iterate through the array and print each value followed by a space.

## Expected Output
```
This is array of strings
```

## Tips
- Ensure your loop has the correct condition to avoid infinite loops.
- Remember to use the correct syntax for accessing array elements.

## Additional Information
- **Array**: An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
- **Loop**: A loop repeatedly executes a block of statements a specified number of times.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect array declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the loop condition and array access statements are correct.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use arrays in Java. Happy coding!
