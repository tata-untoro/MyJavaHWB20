# Exercise 78: Sum of All Elements in a 2D Array

## Objective
Learn how to use 2D arrays in Java to sum and print the total value of all elements.

## Instructions

**Sum of All Elements in a 2D Array**

In this project, you will write a small program that calculates and prints the sum of all elements in a 2D array.

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare and Initialize the 2D Array**
    - Create a 2D array and initialize it with the following values:
    ```
    {
        {-5, -2, -3, 7},
        {1, -5, -2, 2},
        {1, -2, 3, -4}
    }
    ```

2. **Calculate the Sum of All Elements**
    - Use nested loops to iterate through the 2D array and calculate the sum of all elements.

3. **Print the Sum**
    - Print the calculated sum.

## Expected Output
```
-9
```

## Tips
- Ensure your loops have the correct conditions to avoid infinite loops.
- Remember to use the correct syntax for accessing array elements.

## Additional Information
- **2D Array**: A 2D array is an array of arrays, where each element is itself an array. It can be visualized as a table with rows and columns.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect array declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the loop conditions and array access statements are correct.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to sum and print the values of a 2D array in Java. Happy coding!
