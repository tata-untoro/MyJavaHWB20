# Exercise 80: Count Negative and Odd Elements in a 2D Array

## Objective
Learn how to use 2D arrays in Java to count elements based on specific conditions.

## Instructions

**Count Negative and Odd Elements in a 2D Array**

In this project, you will write a small program that counts and prints the total number of elements in a 2D array that are both negative and odd.

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare and Initialize the 2D Array**
    - Create a 2D array and initialize it with the following values:
    ```
    {
        {-5, -2, -3, 7},
        {1, -5, -2, 2},
        {1, -2, 3, -4}
    }
    ```

2. **Count Negative and Odd Elements**
    - Use nested loops to iterate through the 2D array and count the elements that are both negative and odd.

3. **Print the Count**
    - Print the total count of elements that are both negative and odd.

## Example Output
```
3
```

## Tips
- Ensure your loops have the correct conditions to avoid infinite loops.
- Remember to use the correct syntax for accessing array elements.

## Additional Information
- **2D Array**: A 2D array is an array of arrays, where each element is itself an array. It can be visualized as a table with rows and columns.
- **Negative and Odd**: A number is negative if it is less than zero. A number is odd if it is not divisible by 2.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect array declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the loop conditions and array access statements are correct.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to count elements based on specific conditions in a 2D array in Java. Happy coding!
