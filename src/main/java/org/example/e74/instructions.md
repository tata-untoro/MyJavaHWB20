# Exercise 74: Input and Multiply Array Elements

## Objective
Learn how to use arrays in Java to store user input, perform calculations, and print the values.

## Instructions

**Input and Multiply Array Elements**

In this project, you will write a small program that creates an array of integers with a size of 5, inputs values using Scanner, multiplies each value by 10, and then prints the result.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create a Scanner Object**
    - Create a `Scanner` object to read input from the console.

2. **Declare and Initialize the Array**
    - Create an array of integers with a size of 5.

3. **Prompt the User for Input**
    - Use a loop to read 5 integers from the user and store them in the array. (Do not print any prompt message for the user.)

4. **Multiply Each Element by 10**
    - Use another loop to multiply each element of the array by 10 and print the result.

## Example
```
Input:
1
2
3
4
5

Output:
10
20
30
40
50
```

## Tips
- Ensure your loops have the correct conditions to avoid infinite loops.
- Remember to use the correct syntax for accessing and modifying array elements.

## Additional Information
- **Array**: An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
- **Scanner Class**: The `Scanner` class is used to get user input. It is found in the `java.util` package.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect array declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the loop conditions and array access statements are correct.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use arrays, perform calculations, and handle user input in Java. Happy coding!
