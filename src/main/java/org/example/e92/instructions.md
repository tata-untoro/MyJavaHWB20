# Exercise 92: Validate String Endings

## Objective
Learn how to validate if a string ends with specific substrings in Java.

## Instructions

**Validate String Endings**

In this project, you will validate if a string ends with specific substrings and print the results.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create a String Variable**
    - Create a `String` variable named `s1` and assign the value `"hello how are you"` to it.

2. **Validate String Endings**
    - Use the `endsWith()` method of the `String` class to validate if `s1` ends with "u" and print the boolean value.
    - Use the `endsWith()` method of the `String` class to validate if `s1` ends with "world" and print the boolean value.
    - Use the `endsWith()` method of the `String` class to validate if `s1` ends with "are" and print the boolean value.
    - Use the `endsWith()` method of the `String` class to validate if `s1` ends with "you" and print the boolean value.

## Example Output
```
true
false
false
true
```

## Tips
- Ensure your string variable is declared and assigned correctly.
- Remember to use the correct syntax for calling the `endsWith()` method and printing the results.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the string variable is assigned the correct value and the `endsWith()` checks are printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to validate if strings end with specific substrings in Java. Happy coding!
