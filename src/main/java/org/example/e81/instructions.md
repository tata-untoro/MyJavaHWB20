# Exercise 81: Sum of Numbers on Even Index and Even Row in a 2D Array

## Objective
Learn how to use 2D arrays in Java to sum elements based on specific conditions.

## Instructions

**Sum of Numbers on Even Index and Even Row in a 2D Array**

In this project, you will write a small program that sums all numbers that are on even indexes and on even rows in a 2D array and prints the result.

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare and Initialize the 2D Array**
    - Create a 2D array and initialize it with the following values:
    ```
    {
        {-5, -2, -3, 7},
        {1, -5, -2, 2},
        {1, -2, 3, -4}
    }
    ```

2. **Sum Numbers on Even Index and Even Row**
    - Use nested loops to iterate through the 2D array and sum the elements that are on even indexes and even rows.

3. **Print the Sum**
    - Print the calculated sum.

## Example Output
```
-4
```

## Tips
- Ensure your loops have the correct conditions to avoid infinite loops.
- Remember to use the correct syntax for accessing array elements.

## Additional Information
- **2D Array**: A 2D array is an array of arrays, where each element is itself an array. It can be visualized as a table with rows and columns.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect array declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the loop conditions and array access statements are correct.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to sum elements based on specific conditions in a 2D array in Java. Happy coding!
