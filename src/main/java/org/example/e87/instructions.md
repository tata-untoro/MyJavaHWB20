# Exercise 87: Create a Car Class and Objects

## Objective
Learn how to create a class and objects in Java.

## Instructions

**Create a Car Class and Objects**

In this project, you will create a class, define its properties, create objects of the class, and print the objects' properties.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create a Class**
    - Create a class named `Car`.

2. **Declare Variables**
    - Inside the class, declare a `String` variable named `carColor`.
    - Declare an `int` variable named `carYear`.
    - Declare a `String` variable named `carMake`.

3. **Create Objects**
    - Create two objects of the `Car` class.
    - Assign the following values to the first object:
        - `carColor`: "Black"
        - `carYear`: 2019
        - `carMake`: "BMW"
    - Assign the following values to the second object:
        - `carColor`: "White"
        - `carYear`: 2018
        - `carMake`: "Toyota"

4. **Print the Properties**
    - Print the values of the properties for both objects in the following format:
      ```
      Car color is Black and car year is 2019 and car model is BMW
      Car color is White and car year is 2018 and car model is Toyota
      ```

## Example Output
```
Car color is Black and car year is 2019 and car model is BMW
Car color is White and car year is 2018 and car model is Toyota
```

## Tips
- Ensure your class and variables are declared correctly.
- Remember to use the correct syntax for creating objects and accessing their properties.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the variables are assigned the correct values and printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to create classes and objects in Java. Happy coding!
