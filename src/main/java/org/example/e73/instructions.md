# Exercise 73: Input and Print Array Elements in Reverse Order

## Objective
Learn how to use arrays in Java to store user input and print the values in reverse order.

## Instructions

**Input and Print Array Elements in Reverse Order**

In this project, you will write a small program that creates an array of integers, stores 5 elements taken from a user, and then prints all the elements in reverse order.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create a Scanner Object**
    - Create a `Scanner` object to read input from the console.

2. **Declare and Initialize the Array**
    - Create an array of integers that will store 5 elements.

3. **Prompt the User for Input**
    - Use a loop to read 5 integers from the user and store them in the array. (Do not print any prompt message for the user.)

4. **Print the Array Values in Reverse Order**
    - Use another loop to iterate through the array in reverse order and print each value on a new line.

## Example
```
Input:
1
2
3
4
5

Output:
5
4
3
2
1
```

## Tips
- Ensure your loops have the correct conditions to avoid infinite loops.
- Remember to use the correct syntax for accessing array elements.

## Additional Information
- **Array**: An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
- **Scanner Class**: The `Scanner` class is used to get user input. It is found in the `java.util` package.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect array declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the loop conditions and array access statements are correct.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use arrays and handle user input in Java. Happy coding!
