# Exercise 75: Print Values from a 2D Array

## Objective
Learn how to create and use 2D arrays in Java to store and print values.

## Instructions

**Print Values from a 2D Array**

In this project, you will write a small program that creates a 2D array and prints its values.

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare and Initialize the 2D Array**
    - Create a 2D array and initialize it with the following values:
    ```
    {
        {1.4, 2.0, 3.3, 2.0},
        {4.0, 1.5, 6.1, 1.0},
        {1.2, 3.1, 4.0, 1.6}
    }
    ```

2. **Print the 2D Array Values**
    - Use nested loops to iterate through the 2D array and print each value.

## Example Output
```
1.4 2.0 3.3 2.0
4.0 1.5 6.1 1.0
1.2 3.1 4.0 1.6
```

## Tips
- Ensure your loops have the correct conditions to avoid infinite loops.
- Remember to use the correct syntax for accessing array elements.

## Additional Information
- **2D Array**: A 2D array is an array of arrays, where each element is itself an array. It can be visualized as a table with rows and columns.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect array declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the loop conditions and array access statements are correct.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use 2D arrays in Java. Happy coding!
