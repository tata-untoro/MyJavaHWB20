# Exercise 72: Input and Print Days of the Week

## Objective
Learn how to create and use arrays in Java to store user input and print the values.

## Instructions

**Input and Print Days of the Week**

In this project, you will write a small program that creates an array of strings with size 7, asks the user to input the days of the week beginning with Sunday, stores these inputs in the array, and then prints all the values from the array.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create a Scanner Object**
    - Create a `Scanner` object to read input from the console.

2. **Declare and Initialize the Array**
    - Create an array of strings with size 7.

3. **Prompt the User for Input**
    - Use a loop to prompt the user to input the days of the week one by one.
    - Store each input in the array.

4. **Print the Array Values**
    - Use another loop to iterate through the array and print each value on a new line.

## Example Output
```
Please enter day 1 of the week
Sunday
Please enter day 2 of the week
Monday
Please enter day 3 of the week
Tuesday
Please enter day 4 of the week
Wednesday
Please enter day 5 of the week
Thursday
Please enter day 6 of the week
Friday
Please enter day 7 of the week
Saturday
Sunday
Monday
Tuesday
Wednesday
Thursday
Friday
Saturday
```

## Tips
- Ensure your loops have the correct conditions to avoid infinite loops.
- Remember to use the correct syntax for accessing array elements.

## Additional Information
- **Array**: An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
- **Scanner Class**: The `Scanner` class is used to get user input. It is found in the `java.util` package.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect array declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the loop conditions and array access statements are correct.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use arrays and handle user input in Java. Happy coding!
