# Exercise 71: Extract Specific Values from an Array

## Objective
Learn how to use arrays and loops in Java to extract and print specific values.

## Instructions

**Extract Specific Values from an Array**

In this project, you will write a small program that creates an array of integers, and then uses a loop to extract specific values based on a pattern.

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare and Initialize the Array**
    - Create an array of integers with the values {45, 78, 12, 67, 55, 89, 23, 77, 88}.

2. **Extract and Print Specific Values**
    - Use a loop to iterate through the array and print the values at indices that result in the output: 78, 55, 77.

## Expected Output
```
78 55 77
```

## Tips
- Find the correct start point and increment step to get the desired result.
- Ensure your loop has the correct condition to avoid infinite loops.
- Remember to use the correct syntax for accessing array elements.

## Additional Information
- **Array**: An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
- **Loop**: A loop repeatedly executes a block of statements a specified number of times.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect array declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the loop condition and array access statements are correct.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use arrays and loops in Java. Happy coding!
