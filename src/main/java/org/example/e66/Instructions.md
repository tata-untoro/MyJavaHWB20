# Exercise 66: Print Array Values

## Objective
Learn how to create and use arrays in Java to store and print a series of values.

## Instructions

**Print Array Values**

In this project, you will write a small program that creates an array of integers, stores the values 45, 78, 12, 67, and 55, and then prints all array values.

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare and Initialize the Array**
    - Create an array of integers and store the values 45, 78, 12, 67, and 55.

2. **Print the Array Values**
    - Use a loop to iterate through the array and print each value followed by a space.

## Expected Output
```
45 78 12 67 55
```

## Tips
- Ensure your loop has the correct condition to avoid infinite loops.
- Remember to use the correct syntax for accessing array elements.

## Additional Information
- **Array**: An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
- **Loop**: A loop repeatedly executes a block of statements a specified number of times.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect array declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the loop condition and array access statements are correct.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use arrays in Java. Happy coding!
