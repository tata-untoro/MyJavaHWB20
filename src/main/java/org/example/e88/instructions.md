# Exercise 88: Create a Dog Class with Specific Behaviors

## Objective
Learn how to create a class with attributes and behaviors in Java.

## Instructions

**Create a Dog Class with Specific Behaviors**

In this project, you will create a class, define its properties and methods, create objects of the class, and call the methods.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create a Class**
    - Create a class named `Dog`.

2. **Declare Variables**
    - Inside the class, declare `String` variables named `breed`, `name`, and `color`.

3. **Declare Methods**
    - Inside the class, declare methods named `bark()`, `run()`, and `play()` that print messages in the following format:
        - `"Breed can bark"`
        - `"Breed can run"`
        - `"Breed can play"`

4. **Create Objects**
    - Create three objects of the `Dog` class with the following attributes:
        - Husky: breed = "Husky", name = "AnyName", color = "AnyColor"
        - Bulldog: breed = "Bulldog", name = "AnyName", color = "AnyColor"
        - Labrador: breed = "Labrador", name = "AnyName", color = "AnyColor"

5. **Call Methods**
    - Call the methods `bark()`, `run()`, and `play()` for each object.

## Example Output
```
Husky can bark
Husky can run
Husky can play
Bulldog can bark
Bulldog can run
Bulldog can play
Labrador can bark
Labrador can run
Labrador can play
```

## Tips
- Ensure your class and methods are declared correctly.
- Remember to use the correct syntax for creating objects and calling methods.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect method declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the methods are called correctly and the messages are printed as specified.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to create classes with attributes and behaviors in Java. Happy coding!
