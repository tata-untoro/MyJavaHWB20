# Exercise 82: Print a Pattern Using 2D Array

## Objective
Learn how to use 2D arrays and nested loops in Java to print patterns.

## Instructions

**Print a Pattern Using 2D Array**

In this project, you will write a small program that uses a 2D array and nested loops to print a pattern.

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare and Initialize the 2D Array**
    - Create a 2D array and initialize it with the following values to form a pattern:
    ```
    {
        {"*", "*", "*", "*", "*"},
        {"*", "*", "*", "*", "*"},
        {"*", "*", "*", "*", "*"},
        {"*", "*", "*", "*", "*"},
        {"*", "*", "*", "*", "*"},
        {"*", "*", "*", "*", "*"}
    }
    ```

2. **Print the Pattern**
    - Use nested loops to iterate through the 2D array and print the pattern.

## Example Output
```
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *
```

## Tips
- Ensure your loops have the correct conditions to avoid infinite loops.
- Remember to use the correct syntax for accessing array elements.

## Additional Information
- **2D Array**: A 2D array is an array of arrays, where each element is itself an array. It can be visualized as a table with rows and columns.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect array declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the loop conditions and array access statements are correct.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use 2D arrays and nested loops in Java to print patterns. Happy coding!
