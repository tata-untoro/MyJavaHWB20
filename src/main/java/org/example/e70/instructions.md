# Exercise 70: Print Years Using an Array

## Objective
Learn how to create and use arrays in Java to store and print a series of years.

## Instructions

**Print Years Using an Array**

In this project, you will write a small program that creates an array of integers, stores the years from 2010 to 2020 using a `for` loop, and then prints all those values.

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare and Initialize the Array**
    - Create an array of integers with size 11.

2. **Add the Years to the Array Using a For Loop**
    - Use a `for` loop to add the years from 2010 to 2020 to the array.

3. **Print the Array Values**
    - Use another `for` loop to iterate through the array and print each value on a new line.

## Expected Output
```
2010
2011
2012
2013
2014
2015
2016
2017
2018
2019
2020
```

## Tips
- Ensure your loops have the correct conditions to avoid infinite loops.
- Remember to use the correct syntax for accessing array elements.

## Additional Information
- **Array**: An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
- **For Loop**: A `for` loop repeatedly executes a block of statements a specified number of times.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect array declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the loop conditions and array access statements are correct.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use arrays and loops in Java. Happy coding!
