# Exercise 79: Calculate Row Sums in a 2D Array

## Objective
Learn how to use 2D arrays in Java to calculate the sum of elements from each row and store them in a new array.

## Instructions

**Calculate Row Sums in a 2D Array**

In this project, you will write a small program that calculates the sum of elements from each row in a 2D array and adds them into an array of integers.

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare and Initialize the 2D Array**
    - Create a 2D array and initialize it with the following values:
    ```
    {
        {1, 1, 2}, //sum = 4
        {3, 1, 2}, //sum = 6
        {3, 5, 3}, //sum = 11
        {0, 1, 2}  //sum = 3
    }
    ```

2. **Calculate the Sum of Each Row**
    - Use nested loops to iterate through the 2D array and calculate the sum of each row.
    - Store the sums in a new array of integers.

3. **Print the Row Sums**
    - Print the values of the new array.

## Example Output
```
4
6
11
3
```

## Tips
- Ensure your loops have the correct conditions to avoid infinite loops.
- Remember to use the correct syntax for accessing array elements.

## Additional Information
- **2D Array**: A 2D array is an array of arrays, where each element is itself an array. It can be visualized as a table with rows and columns.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect array declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the loop conditions and array access statements are correct.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to calculate and store row sums from a 2D array in Java. Happy coding!
