# Exercise 85: Print Number Pattern

## Objective
Learn how to use nested loops in Java to print patterns.

## Instructions

**Print Number Pattern**

In this project, you will write a small program that uses nested loops to print a number pattern.

**For you to do:**

1. **Print the Number Pattern**
    - Use nested loops to print the number pattern.

## Expected Output
```
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4
1 2 3
1 2

```

## Tips
- Ensure your loops have the correct conditions to avoid infinite loops.
- Remember to use the correct syntax for accessing array elements and printing values.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the loop conditions and print statements are correct.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use nested loops in Java to print patterns. Happy coding!
